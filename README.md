# hello-world
Following the guide

As I am creating these edits, I am following the GitHub guide to setting up the respositories and such. I am a graduated Electrical Engineer and I am interested in entering the Embedded systems field. Thus far I have had experience in manufacturing and rail, but I have always been drawn to the combination of hardware and software from the very bottom up. 

I'll make a few game projects to show my proficinecy in C++, after a few C++ projects I'll get into Python which I imagine will not be too hard, and Linux to create complete applications. 

The ultimate goal is to create several projects to prove my proficiency in C++ programming.
